# Website for Stanford Students in Entertainment

## Description
Welcome to my project! This is the very first website I ever created it. It is a website that a club I am on the
e-board of at my school, Stanford Students in Entertainment, can use for the upcoming 2023-2024 school year. 
The idea arose from the fact that we were paying a solid price in order to use a website building company, and 
realized we could save money if we built a webiste from scratch. As someone who has an  interest in front-end/full
stack, I thought it would be a good opportunity to challenge myself and gain experience in this area!

the website:
